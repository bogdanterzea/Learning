# Learning
In this repository, I'll upload the programming articles that I read with a summary to them.

### Why I'm doing this?
- When I started my first programming job I had to take documentation from different sources from different places and to search for it a lot.
- The links and documents I found, took me some time to search, and even found links that weren't helpful or were repeated stuff.

### Why would you read my summaries?
- You don't have to believe my summary of each chapter. I'll post links so you can read on your own and learn meaningful stuff.
- You won't have to search on all the internet for it... I'll keep it updated here :D
