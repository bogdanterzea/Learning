Active listening should be practiced respecting the following "rules":

- It's not ok to rush the speaker
- Stay focused at the discussion, don't get distracted

What benefits active listening can bring:
- Better understanding of a problem/idea/point of view.
- Validates the speaker and make him want to expose more his idea
- Reflects patience and will improve collaboration with people around.
- Integrate faster in a friendship because the person will see that you want to hear their stories and will be comfortable with you

Things to practice:
- don't fold arms when listening to someone because it signals that you're not listening
- make eye contact 60%-70% of the time
- Paraphrase, is less rude than giving unasked opinions.
- Don't interrupt
- Avoid daydreaming. You're there to listen that person, not the voices in your head!
- Be patient
- Be open, neutral and don't judge.

How to improve others the active-listening ability:
- Find a topic that both like.
- Become yourself the active-listener if the other person brings good topics in discussion
- if the other person it's interested only to be the speaker and not let you participate to discussion, just let him talk and retreat.

## [Good presentation](https://biteable.com/blog/tips/how-to-make-good-presentation/)

### How to make a good presentation:
- keep it simple; three sections are enough - introduction, body and conclusion
- don't make it longer than 10 slides

- be consistent with the font.
- format your text in a friendly way
- you can rearrange your thoughts so don't be afraid to read every idea down in presentation
- keep only the essentially
- pick someone to review it....he/she may find out some mistakes and can be helpful
- surprise the audience...do something different, not a boring start
- maybe include a rhetorical question
- if you know your audience, take advantage and use what they like in your topics
- don't try to impress. Speak from your heart.
- use humor
- don't be afraid to mess it up and just do it. What you have to lose?
- you can be vulnerable and add what you feel inside your presentation
- repeat the presentation for yourself first to make sure your message will make sense
- keep some back-up in case presentation tools fails and you have to fill the time
- control your time...try to use a timer to make sure you're in time allocated.
- to make people remember something, say it slowly and let that sink for a moment
- "they might forget what you said but they'll never forget the way you made them feel" -- Maya Angelou

## [The XY problem](http://xyproblem.info/)
How it occurs:
- the user is asking about the solutions that he thinks will solve the problem instead of asking about the problem and then proposing a solution.
- user doesn't know how y should work either
- others will try to help with y but that's not the real problem
- people get stuck on their solution which may not be good

Solutions:
- Always describe the main problem, not the solution you think will solve it.
- Be ready to provide many details about it.
- Share with others what you already tried to use
