## [Active listening](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-active-listening-3024343)
Active listening should be practiced respecting the following "rules":
- Be nonjudgmental
- Be patient
- Pay attention to both verbal and non-verbal feedback and show it.
- Ask clarification questions when you consider.
- Use summarizing to be sure the idea was well understood.
- Don't interrupt the speaker
- It's not ok to rush the speaker
- Stay focused at the discussion, don't get distracted

What benefits active listening can bring:
- Better understanding of a problem/idea/point of view.
- Validates the speaker and make him want to expose more his idea
- Reflects patience and will improve collaboration with people around.
- Integrate faster in a friendship because the person will see that you want to hear their stories and will be comfortable with you

Things to practice:
- don't fold arms when listening to someone because it signals that you're not listening
- make eye contact 60%-70% of the time
- Paraphrase, is less rude than giving unasked opinions.
- Don't interrupt
- Avoid daydreaming. You're there to listen that person, not the voices in your head!
- Be patient
- Be open, neutral and don't judge.

How to improve others the active-listening ability:
- Find a topic that both like.
- Become yourself the active-listener if the other person brings good topics in discussion
- if the other person it's interested only to be the speaker and not let you participate to discussion, just let him talk and retreat.
